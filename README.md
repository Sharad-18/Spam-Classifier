# Spam-Classifier
This project focuses on the development of a robust Spam Classifier using machine learning techniques. The classifier is designed to accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate messages, thereby aiding in effective email filtering and enhancing cybersecurity measures.

Key Features:

Robust Classifier: The Spam Classifier is developed using machine learning algorithms to ensure high accuracy in identifying spam messages.
Data Preprocessing: Extensive data preprocessing techniques are employed to optimize the model's performance, ensuring reliable results in real-world applications.
Testing and Validation: Rigorous testing and validation methodologies are implemented during the development process to guarantee the classifier's robustness and reliability.
Continuous Monitoring: The classifier is equipped with continuous monitoring and updates to adapt to evolving spam tactics, maintaining peak performance over time.
Technology Stack:

Python: The project is developed using Python programming language.
Pandas: Pandas library is utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: NumPy is used for numerical computing and array operations.
Naïve Bayes Algorithm: The Naïve Bayes algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
